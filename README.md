<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While pentesting it is sometime hard to find a good worldlist to run with *dirb, wfuzz, gobuster, ffuf and others*.

This project aims to give a good and complete wordlist for discovery (including French words). Put extensions accordingly to your webapp.

For extensions file, I recommand the [Raft file extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content).

I have removed weird and "difficult" to type letter:
```sh
sed -i '/ï/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ö/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ä/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ü/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/û/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ô/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/î/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/â/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/â/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ê/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/é/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/è/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ë/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/ù/d' decouverte.txt
sed -i '/µ/d' decouverte.txt
```

The size of the wordlist is about:
```sh
wc -l decouverte.txt 
194611 decouverte.txt
```

### Built With
